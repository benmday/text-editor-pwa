## Description
  
  This app is a progressive web application, meaning it can be downloaded directly to your device and used offline. Assets are cached so that a network connection is not required to access it. This text editor uses IndexDB in the backend to save user input. Each time it is opened it will automatically load the previous text input in the editor.
